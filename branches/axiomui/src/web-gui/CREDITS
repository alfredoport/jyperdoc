Many thanks go to the fine folks of Google (and Google itself) as well
as LispNYC and Heow Eide-Goodman for sponsoring this project during
the Google Summer of Code 2005.

I am also very grateful to my mentors Bill Page and Tim Daly as well
as the friendly and supportive people on the axiom-developer mailing
list. I am particularly indebted to Bob McElrath, Martin Rubey, Camm
Maguire, William Sit and Ralf Hemmecke.
